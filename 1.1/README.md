## Exercise 1.1

Calculate the partial widths of the Z and W bosons and the t quark and
compare with the analytic formulas you find in preferred QFT book.

## Solution

Running `script.txt` we obtain the following partial widths (available in `param_card.dat`):
- $\Gamma_Z$ = 2.441755 GeV
- $\Gamma_W$ = 2.047910 GeV
- $\Gamma_t$ = 1.491472e GeV

which are compatible with the widths currently available in the [PDG](https://pdg.lbl.gov/).

- $\Gamma_Z^{\text{PDG}}$ = 2.4955±0.0023 GeV
- $\Gamma_W^{\text{PDG}}$ = 2.085±0.042 GeV
- $\Gamma_t^{\text{PDG}}$ = 1.42+0.19−0.15 GeV
