## Exercise 2.1

(a) Derive the expression for the amplitude square of $e^+ e^- \rightarrow q \bar{q}$ with a photon exchange.
(b)Include diagram where $Z$ boson is exchanged.

## Solution
(a) See [here](./Photon.pdf) for the derivation of $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \gamma^* \rightarrow q \bar{q}$.
(b) See [here](./Z.pdf) for the calculation where also the process of $e^+ e^- \rightarrow Z_0 \rightarrow q \bar{q}$ it is considered. In the final differential cross section it appears a term proportional to $\cos \theta$ compared to (a) where only a term proportional to $\cos^2 \theta$ is present.
